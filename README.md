# Counterparty Asset and Developer Timeline 2014-2021

---
---

This repo is dedicated to publicly organizing and critiquing a public list for Counterparty’s vast historical assets/tokens, projects and developer updates to the Counterparty Protocol we have seen since Counterparty’s inception. 

(Some assets post 2021 have been included, but since so many projects and notable assets have been made since 2021, most of the recent projects have been omitted to focus on the previous historical developments of the older tokens.)

## Goal

---

The goal for this list is to eventually include the data into a cool infographic style Historical Timeline to be published on [Counterparty.io](https://counterparty.io/) in a new page titled “History”. 

This timeline idea was originally published in [this Counterparty Forum post](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/updating-information-on-counterparty-io/6669/8) which was about updating the Counterparty website to include more current information. It was then moved to these two posts: [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-developer-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6675) and [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-token-asset-project-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6688), but now finally lives here in this repo.

It is my hope that this data below will give more inspirational education to the current and future Counterparty community, as well as give light on historical and groundbreaking projects done in the past using the Counterparty protocol.

## Creative Design

I am imagining this timeline to be a linear/flat infographic that has certain events “expand” upon hovering over them with more in-depth information about each asset/project and its significance. 

It is my intention to reach out to an experienced graphic designer for this project as I believe the timeline should follow a few guidelines for the creative side of things:

- The Color scheme should be matching the Logo and Color Scheme of Counterparty.io (need a well seasoned pro to get this feeling right)
- The timeline should be readable and scrollable (maybe even zoomable) on a mobile device as well as Desktop.
- We could possibly find someone who is excited and knowledgeable about XCP that may have many more hours of experience (and/or pool some donations to pay them for their work).


The final product could look something like how Whiterabbit1111 designed his timeline:
